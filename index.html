      Hello, thank you for visiting my page My name is Timothee Odushina. I am an Army veteran with supply logistis and
      warehouse experience. I am a Software Developper student here at Codefellows and I am very exited to learn new
      skills. I love challenging myself and this that is one of the reason I decided to switch to the Tech career. I
      will be using Windows 10 system. I currently live in El Paso, Texas and I love spending time with my family. I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering which I obtained overseas. I have experience in road and building
      construction. With my miltary service, I gained about 7 years experience in logistics management in Aviation and
      ground vehicles maintenance. My goal now is to become a Software Developper and grow up in the field to gain
      experience and expertise.
